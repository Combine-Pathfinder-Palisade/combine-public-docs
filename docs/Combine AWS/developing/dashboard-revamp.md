# Dashboard Revamp

Wishlist items for the revamped tap frontend! Mine are:
- unit testing! And we can use AI somehow to get automated tests, and no more of those silly spec.ts files in the components that don’t do anything
- release notes page in markdown instead of html
- keep tap-server-mock because it’s awesome
- add a way to test a local frontend against an existing aws account so that we don’t have to push the war up to do integration tests
